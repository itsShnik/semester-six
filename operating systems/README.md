### 1. Introuduction

__What is an OS?__: An operating system provides an interface to the user applications to interact with the hardware. OS manages the resources and services allocated to an application program and also controls all the processes / jobs to be executed. We shall elaborate on what a process and a job is later on.

__Structure of the OS__: By structure we refer to the control flow in an operating system. How does the os work as an intermediary between the applciations and the hardware? Take this for example, you are running an applcation that requires you to take the input from the keyboar, this service is provided by the os, os informs the device controller to take the input and then it transfers the input wherever needed.

__Kernel__: The kernel is the part of the operating system closest to the hardware, it is the set of functions that provide essential functionalities of the operating system, much like what a heart does to the human.

A kernel is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of the startup as well as the input/output requests from the software, translating them into data processing instructions to be executed by the cpu. It is loaded in a protected space in the memory that the applications can't mess with. It handles the peripherals like the keyboard, mouse and speakers.

The applications (user programs) might want to interact with the kernel requesting for the input. How does that happen? How do the applications and other os programs like shell interact with the kernel? One of the methods is __interrupt__.

__Interrupt__: We can think of the interrupt as a wake up call to the kernel, when interrupt comes, some functionalities of the kernel is invoked. It is a signal generated by a software/hardware.
