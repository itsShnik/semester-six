A repository aimed to make notes for sixth semester in computer science, to help everyone.

## Contributing

This repository is created to make notes for various courses in computer science sixth semester. You can add notes, sources, research projects and all kinds of relevant stuff which will be helpful for everyone. Currently, I am planning to add lecturewise notes written in markdown, and I am looking for new ideas to make this a successful project.

If you want to contribute to this repository to help everyone including yourself, please send me an email @ shnikisme@gmail.com and I will make you a collaborator.
